# check-citation-nonr v1
"""Citation-metadata consistency gate for repositories without a DESCRIPTION.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `CITATION.cff` and `.zenodo.json` each carry a copy of the
release version, and nothing asserts that the copy is right. In the R packages
`scripts/check-citation.py` keeps both in step with `DESCRIPTION`. The Node and
Swift repositories joining Zenodo have no `DESCRIPTION`, so that gate has
nothing to read there, and without a gate of their own their metadata drifts
from the release it names: measured on the R fleet, four of seven repositories
had drifted before a gate existed (SEOR-lreejxat). This is the smaller sibling
for the repositories that keep their version somewhere else. Why it is a
separate script rather than more sources in the R one is
design/adr/0006-non-r-citation-metadata-has-its-own-gate.md.

WHERE THE VERSION LIVES. Each repository declares its source with `--source`
on the hook entry. The flag is required and has no default: the gate never
guesses, because a guess is exactly how a repository whose `package.json` holds
a placeholder would come to cite the placeholder.

* `--source package-json` - the `version` field of `package.json` at the
  repository root. Node repositories bump it when they release and leave it
  alone in between, so it always names the latest release. In step means
  `CITATION.cff` `version:` and `.zenodo.json` `"version"` equal it exactly.
  Bump all three in the release commit.
* `--source git-tag` - the highest `vX.Y.Z` tag merged into HEAD, compared as
  numbers (so v0.10.0 is newer than v0.9.0), with the `v` stripped. For
  repositories with no manifest version (Swift) and for ones whose
  `package.json` holds a `0.0.0` placeholder; the placeholder is never read.
  In step means both files equal that tag. Between releases they keep naming
  the latest tag, just as an R package's `X.Y.Z.9000` still cites `X.Y.Z`.
  Only `vX.Y.Z` tags count: `v2.0.0-rc.1`, `v1.2` or `vendor-foo` are ignored.
  "Merged into HEAD" is what the tree descends from, so a branch cut before the
  latest release is judged against the release it was cut from. The tag has to
  exist when the gate runs: bump the files, commit, tag that commit, then push
  (the pre-push hook sees local tags).

NEVER RELEASED. When the source names no release - `package.json` says
`0.0.0`, or no `vX.Y.Z` tag is merged into HEAD - there is no version to cite.
Both files then carry no version, no `date-released` and no DOI, the same
honesty clause the R gate applies to a package that has never released. A
file that does claim a version in that state fails, which is also what a
shallow or tagless clone looks like, so the gate fails loudly there instead of
passing: CI for a `git-tag` repository needs git and the tags in the image
(on GitLab, `GIT_DEPTH: 0`).

WHAT IT CHECKS.

1. `CITATION.cff` `version:` equals the release the source names.
2. `.zenodo.json` `"version"`, same rule.
3. A repository that has never released claims no version, no
   `date-released` and no DOI in either file.
4. A repository carrying neither file passes: whether it should have them is a
   separate question, not drift.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK, ON PURPOSE.

* URLs. The R gate cross-checks them against `DESCRIPTION`'s `URL:`; there is
  no equivalent single field here, and inventing one would be a rule nobody
  decided.
* Whether `date-released` is the tag's date. The R gate does not check that
  either.
* The network. Everything is read from the working tree and local git.

Stdlib only, so it runs in a bare Python image or any repository without adding
a dependency. `CITATION.cff` is read with a deliberately small top-level-scalar
reader rather than a YAML parser for the same reason; it refuses to guess when
the file does not have that shape.

#
# THIS FILE IS VENDORED. seor holds the reference copy; each non-R repository
# carrying citation metadata holds a byte-identical implementation, because a
# fresh clone's hooks cannot depend on a sibling checkout. The mechanism is
# check-citation.py's (SEOR-tssbiedr): the digest below covers the
# IMPLEMENTATION -- every byte below the module docstring, minus this
# assignment -- so the prose above may differ per repository while any change
# to behavior is caught. Bytes rather than a parse-tree hash, so the digest
# does not move with the Python version running it.
#
# `main()` verifies it on every run, so it is armed in every copy whether or
# not that repository runs `--self-test`. Whether the copies agree is one grep:
#
#     grep -h '^IMPLEMENTATION_DIGEST' ~/Projects/*/scripts/check-citation-nonr.py | sort -u
#
# One line out means every copy is in sync. Re-bless it in every copy in the
# same change, never in one. It is a different digest from check-citation.py's
# on purpose: the two scripts are re-blessed independently (ADR 0006).
