# seor 0.0.0.9000

* Initial metapackage scaffold.
* `library(seor)` installs and attaches the member packages `rurl`,
  `punycoder`, `pslr`, `sitemapr` and `pagerankr`; the planned member
  `robotstxtr` is attached opportunistically when installed.
* Added `seor_packages()` and `seor_conflicts()` helpers.

## Internal

* CI now appends CRAN behind the pinned Posit Package Manager snapshot, so a
  dependency published to CRAN too recently for p3m to have synced still
  resolves (SEOR-arofvftg).
